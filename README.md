# Using Facial Recognition Techniques to Detect Genetic Disease

- Project developed in Summer 2017 under the mentorship of Dr. Chin-Fu Chen at the Greenwood Genetics Center. 
- Machine learning classifier that uses facial recognition techniques to detect 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome. 
- Used WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) to train classifiers. 
- Best results from Sequential Minimal Optimization using Support Vector Machine (SMO, SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (simple neural network).
- Early detection is key, so finding training data of children is important.
- In addition, differences of race and lack of training data make this an especially challenging problem for the classifier for racial minorities
